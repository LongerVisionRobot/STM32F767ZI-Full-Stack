# Preface

[**STM32F767ZI Full Stack**](https://longer-vision-robot.gitbook.io/stm32f767zi-full-stack/) is an open source book entirely written by [Longer Vision Robot](http://www.longervisionrobot.com). In this book, [STM32 Nucleo-144 development board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html) with [STM32F767ZI MCU](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html) is to be discussed in details. You will get familiar with:

* CPU specifications about [STM32F767ZI MCU](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html)
* Detailed specifications about [STM32 Nucleo-144 development board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html)
* [IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit)
* 720 Hollow Cup [Brushless DC Motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor)
* How to control the display via [STM32F767ZI MCU](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html)
* Some communication sensors, including [RC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_control), bluetooth and wifi, etc.
* And our target of this book is to finally build a [STM32F767ZI MCU](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html) based drone, namely, an Mini-size Autonomous Drone with selected sensors.

The book is published on gitbook at: [https://longer-vision-robot.gitbooks.io/stm32f767zi-full-stack/](https://longer-vision-robot.gitbooks.io/stm32f767zi-full-stack/), and all source code is tested and released on github at: [https://github.com/LongerVisionRobot/Examples_STM32F767ZI](https://github.com/LongerVisionRobot/Examples_STM32F767ZI).

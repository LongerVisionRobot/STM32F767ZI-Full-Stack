# Preface

[**STM32F767ZI Full Stack**](https://longer-vision-robot.gitbook.io/stm32f767zi-full-stack/) is an open source book entirely written by [Longer Vision Robot](http://www.longervisionrobot.com). In this book, [**STM32 Nucleo-144 development board**](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html) with [**STM32F767ZI MCU**](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html) is to be discussed in details. You will get familiar with:

* CPU specifications about [**STM32F767ZI MCU**](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html)
* 40 fundamental sensors by around 40 examples
* DC motor, stepper motor, servor motor, etc., with several examples
* How to control the display via [**STM32F767ZI MCU**](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html)
* Some communication sensors, including bluetooth and wifi, etc.
* And our target of this book is to finally build an [**STM32F767ZI MCU**](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html) based drone, namely, an Mini-size Autonomous Drone with selected sensors.

The book is published on gitbook at: [https://longer-vision-robot.gitbooks.io/stm32f767zi-full-stack/](https://longer-vision-robot.gitbooks.io/stm32f767zi-full-stack/), and all source code is tested and released on github at: [https://github.com/LongerVisionRobot/Examples_STM32F767ZI](https://github.com/LongerVisionRobot/Examples_STM32F767ZI).

# 2.3 QEMU Simulation (Optional)

In the [previous section](../02_Programming_for_STM32/02_hello_world.md), we have **NOT** run/test/debug the program yet. How to do that? Normally, there are 2 ways to test your code before flashing your code down to a chip. 
* **Way 1**: Test in a simulator, which simulates the **STM32** chip
* **Way 2**: Test on a real **STM32** development board
In this section, we are going to talk about how to run/test/debug the program in the popular simulator [**QEMU**](https://www.qemu.org/).

# 1.2 STM32F767ZI

According to ST's official website [http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f767zi.html),

> The STM32F765xx, STM32F767xx, STM32F768Ax and STM32F769xx devices are based on the high-performance Arm速 Cortex速-M7 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 216 MHz frequency. The Cortex速-M7 core features a floating point unit (FPU) which supports Arm速 double-precision and single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances the application security.

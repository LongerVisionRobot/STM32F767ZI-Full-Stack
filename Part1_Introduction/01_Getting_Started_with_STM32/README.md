# Chapter 1 - Getting Started with STM32

According to ST's official website [http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html), 
> The STM32 family of 32-bit Flash microcontrollers based on the Arm® Cortex®-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers products combining very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, and low-power and low-voltage operation, and connectivity, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

STM32's Ecosystem can be summarized as:

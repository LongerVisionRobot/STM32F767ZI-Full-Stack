STM32Cube covers the whole STM32 portfolio.\nSTM32Cube includes STM32CubeMX, a graphical software configuration tool that allows the generation of C initialization code using graphical wizards.\nIt also embeds comprehensive STM32Cube MCU Packages, delivered per STM32 microcontroller Series (such as STM32CubeF4 for STM32F4 Series). These packages include the STM32Cube HAL (an STM32 abstraction layer embedded software ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio), the STM32Cube LL (low-layer APIs, a fast, light-weight, expert-oriented layer), plus a consistent set of middleware components such as RTOS, USB, TCP/IP and graphics. All the embedded software utilities are delivered with a full set of examples.\n\nThe reason why STM32CubeMX is optional for installation is just because STM32CubeMX contains comprehensive STM32Cube MCU Packages.\nOn website http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html, click on Get Software at the bottom, and Accept the License Agreement.

For the time being, the most recent Eclipse release is Eclipse Oxygen 3A, and what we are using is Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers - Linux 64-bit.\nStep 2: Install GNU MCU Plug-ins for Eclipse\nAccording to GNU MCU Eclipse:\n\nGNU MCU Eclipse is an open source project that includes a family of Eclipse plug-ins and tools for multi-platform embedded ARM and RISC-V development, based on GNU toolchains. This project is hosted on GitHub. The former project was hosted on GitHub and SourceForge.\n\nThe right-hand sidebar on GNU MCU Eclipse clearly summarizes what's needed to be installed, as in the following image:\n\nAccording to our summation, four things must be installed:\n\nEclipse Plug-in\nARM toolchain\nJ-Link\nST-Link\n\nA. Install Eclipse Plug-in\nCurrently, if you install the plugin from within Eclipse by providing the plugin's update site URL http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates, you will possibly meet the following error message:\n\nTherefore, we have this Eclipse Plugin installed from within Eclipse MarketPlace as follows:\n\nB. Install ARM Toolchain\nIt's clearly summarized in https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/toolchain/arm/install/ that there are 2 ways to carry out the installation for GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC: The xPack install and Manual install.\nThe manual install is strongly recommended. You ONLY need to visit GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC, and download the corresponding file. gnu-mcu-eclipse-arm-none-eabi-gcc-7.2.2-1.1-20180401-0515-centos64.tgz is downloaded and extracted under /opt/GCCToolChains in our case. Let's have a look at what files are under the ARM toolchain folder:\n/opt/GCCToolChains/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/7.2.2-1.1-20180401-0515/bin$ ls\narm-none-eabi-addr2line  arm-none-eabi-elfedit    arm-none-eabi-gcc-ranlib  arm-none-eabi-gprof    arm-none-eabi-ranlib\narm-none-eabi-ar         arm-none-eabi-g++        arm-none-eabi-gcov        arm-none-eabi-ld       arm-none-eabi-readelf\narm-none-eabi-as         arm-none-eabi-gcc        arm-none-eabi-gcov-dump   arm-none-eabi-ld.bfd   arm-none-eabi-size\narm-none-eabi-c++        arm-none-eabi-gcc-7.2.2  arm-none-eabi-gcov-tool   arm-none-eabi-nm       arm-none-eabi-strings\narm-none-eabi-c++filt    arm-none-eabi-gcc-ar     arm-none-eabi-gdb         arm-none-eabi-objcopy  arm-none-eabi-strip\narm-none-eabi-cpp        arm-none-eabi-gcc-nm     arm-none-eabi-gdb-py      arm-none-eabi-objdump\nC. Install J-Link\nThe J-Link binaries are available at SEGGER. In our case, DEB installer 64-bit is to be downloaded from https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Linux_x86_64.deb. And to install it, we ONLY need to double-click this deb file under Ubuntu.\nJ-Link is defaultly installed under folder /opt/SEGGER.\n/opt/SEGGER$ ls -ls\ntotal 4\n0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   23 May 11 07:33 JLink -> /opt/SEGGER/JLink_V632c\n4 drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4096 May 15 13:04 JLink_V632c\nD. Install ST-Link\nThe reason why we need to install ST-Link is that Nucleo-144 board with STM32F767ZI comes with a ST-Link on board. The processes on how to checkout and build the source code are clearly displayed by the following commands:\n$ git clone git@github.com:jiapei100/stlink.git\n$ cd stlink\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ ccmake ../\n$ make -j8\n$ sudo make install\nFour exe files are respectively installed as:\n\n/usr/local/bin/st-flash\n/usr/local/bin/st-info\n/usr/local/bin/st-util\n/usr/local/bin/stlink-gui\n\nStep 3: Update Packs\nA. Packs: Open Perspective\nClick on Window->Perspective->Open Perspective->Other, you will see the following perspective:\n\nB. Packs: Operation In Progress\nThen double click Packs, and click the refresh button to Update the packages definitions from all repositories.\n\nC. Packs: Install Required Packs\nAfter around half an hour on my computer, and multiple times of clicking Retry and Ignore, I got the following views:\n\nIt's NOT hard to find STMicroelectronics->STM32F7 Series and have STM32F7xx_DFP installed. The NEWEST version 2.9.0 will be installed by default.\n\nStep 4: Window Preference\nFinally, we configure Eclipse IDE for STM32 MCU development. Click on Window->Preferences.\nA. C/C++ - MCU Packages\nMCU Packages\n\nMCU Packages Repositories\nAccording to the description on https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/plugins/packs-manager/, we need to input http://www.keil.com/pack/index.pidx into URL in dialog MCU Packages - Repositories, as follows:\n\nB. MCU\nGlobal ARM Toolchains Paths\n\nAlternatively, you can configure OpenOCD toolchain instead.\n\nAlternatively, you can configure RISC-V toolchain instead.\n\nGlobal QEMU Path\n\nGlobal SEGGER J-Link Path\n\nC. Workspace Preference\nJust enable save automatically before build and UTF-8 encoding within Workspace Preference.\n\n2.2.2 SW4STM32 (System Workbench for STM32)\nTo install the free IDE System Workbench for STM32, ST's official website is redirected to OpenSTM32. Users must first register on OpenSTM32, and then strictly follow Installing System Workbench for STM32.\nSince we are going to use 2.2.1 GNU MCU Eclipse throughout our course, we are NOT going to elaborate how to carry out the development for STM32 using System Workbench for STM32.\n"},"Part1_Introduction/02_Programming_for_STM32/03_hello_world.html":{"url":"Part1_Introduction/02_Programming_for_STM32/03_hello_world.html","title":"2.3 FIRST STM32 Project - Hello World","keywords":"","body":"2.3 FIRST STM32 Project - \"Hello World\"\nAs any other programming languages, our first STM32 Project is also \"Hello World\", without hardware wiring.
